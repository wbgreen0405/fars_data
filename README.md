# FARS: Accident Data Analysis package

This is an `R` package created for Coursera course [Building R Packages](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-packages/home). It contains several basic functions for analyzing data from Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) - [source](http://www.nhtsa.gov/Data/Fatality-Analysis-Reporting-System-(FARS)). The point is to demonstrate ability to document functions, create vignettes and tests and also to include data with the package.
